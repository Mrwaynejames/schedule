# schedule

## Description

Developign I developed was a work day schedulel to allow users to plan out the tasks of their day. Within this the scheudle was broken up by hour into 8 section labeled 9-5. Through out the day the scheudle will update the user about where they are at within the scheudle. Any time slot that is in the past will be in grey, the present hour will be red, and the fututre hours will be in green. Don't worry about your tasks dispperating once you save a task it will remain their until you remove it.

Keeping track of an 8 hour day and the pace at which you need to move through out your day can be a chellenge. This schedule not only helps you plan your day but let you knwo if you are on track by the hour.

I was able to do this by refrencing the moment() function too get up to date dates and time. Once that is done you need to establish an if function for each hour to let it knwo what color it need to be depending on if its in the past, present, or future. By using By using jquery and Javascript tools I coudl save the inputs into local storge saving them to the site for the users convenience.
